This project involves building a compact weather monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The main objective is to collect and transmit real-time temperature and humidity data from the environment to a user interface, which is implemented as a Telegram bot created via BOT FATHER. To achieve this, we integrate a DHT11 sensor with the ESP32 to capture temperature and humidity readings, which are then sent to the Telegram bot for user access and monitoring.
